# Accessible Web Components using HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates the development of accessible and responsive web components using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It highlights the ability to build user-friendly interfaces that follow semantic structure, accessibility principles, and clean design practices.

## Overview

AccessibleWebComponents showcases front-end development skills through the creation of structured, interactive, and standards-compliant web pages. The project is divided into three key parts:
1. **HTML & CSS Components:** Development of accessible web elements such as tables, navigation bars, and login forms.
2. **Portfolio & Resume Page:** A responsive personal portfolio site combining layout, accessibility, and animation features.
3. **JavaScript Core Scripting:** Logical programming exercises demonstrating essential JavaScript syntax and structure.

## Features

1. **HTML & CSS Components**
   * **Web Table:** Fully accessible table with proper semantic makeup and custom styling.
   * **Navigation Bar:** A Flexbox-based, responsive navigation menu featuring hover and visited link states.
   * **Login Form:** A centered, modal-style login form built with Flexbox/Grid, applying selector-based styling.
2. **Portfolio & Resume Page**
   * Semantic HTML5 structure with clear content hierarchy.
   * Layout built using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and Box Model principles.
   * Use of CSS Custom Properties, animations, and pseudo-elements for enhanced design.
   * Responsive design through media queries for different screen sizes.
   * Accessible color palette and contrast testing.
3. **JavaScript Core Scripting**
   * **Leap Year Checker:** Determines whether a given year is a leap year.
   * **Pyramid Builder:** Creates a text-based pyramid structure dynamically.
   * **Title Case Converter:** Formats a string so each word begins with a capital letter.

## Code Structure

* **index.html:** Contains the HTML strucutre and component makeup.
* **style.css:** External stylesheet controlling layout, colors, and visual behavior.
* **script.js:** Contains JavaScript logic for each scripting exercise.
* **testing.md:** Includes documentation and screenshots for accessibility and browser testing.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern browser.
3. Explore:
   * HTML & CSS Components and layout responsiveness.
   * Console outputs from the JavaScript scripts demonstrating logic functionality.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Frontend Development:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Layout Techniques:** Flexbox, Grid, Box Model
* **Accessibilty & Semantics:** WCAG concepts, valid HTML structure, color contrast
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for structured commits
* **Testing & Validation:** HTML validation, cross-browser and accessibility checks

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of COIS 2430 - Web Development: Front-end at Trent University. It reflects the abiltiy to design and implement web interfaces that are accessible, semantic, visually consistent, and technically sound, aligning with industry standards for modern front-end development.
